# fpga-magic-1
This is an FPGA implementation of the Magic-1 homebrew CPU (http://www.homebrewcpu.com/).
This is a fork of this project: http://github.com/laurarg94/fpga-magic-1
It's the same as the fpga-magic-1 imported from google code but only the VHDL files are included.
The hex files for the PROMs are the same.
